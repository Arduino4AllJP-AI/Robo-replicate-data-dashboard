# Robo Replicate Data Dashboard

**A real-time data bridge & dashboard for MQTT â†’ InfluxDB + SQL Server**

This project consists of two Python components:

1. **`mqtt_bridge_sql_influx.py`**

   * Subscribes to a specified MQTT topic.
   * Parses incoming JSON payloads.
   * Writes data points to InfluxDB (if configured).
   * Logs or circularly stores the latest 100 records in a SQL Server table.
   * Exports the latest 100 records to `historical_data.csv`.

2. **`Tele_Robo_Bridge.py`**

   * A Flask-based dashboard and control panel.
   * Shows current bridge status (running/not running).
   * Displays a live list of devices and their last-seen timestamps from SQL Server.
   * Allows on-demand launch of the MQTT bridge script.
   * Provides a dark/light theme toggle.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

* **MQTT Integration**: Reliable subscription with retry logic.
* **Dual Storage**: Pushes telemetry to InfluxDB and a SQL Server table.
* **Circular Buffer**: Keeps only the latest 100 rows in SQL to prevent unbounded growth.
* **CSV Export**: Automatic snapshot of recent data in `historical_data.csv`.
* **Web Dashboard**: Simple Flask UI to monitor bridge status and device activity.
* **Configurable**: All connection parameters in a single `config.txt` file.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

* **Windows 10/11** (or any OS with Windows-style batch support)
* **Python 3.8+**
* **MQTT broker** (hostname, port, credentials)
* **InfluxDB** (URL, token, org, bucket)
* **SQL Server** (ODBC driver 17)
* **Git** (to clone/update the repo)

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arduino4AllJP-AI/Robo-replicate-data-dashboard.git
   cd Robo-replicate-data-dashboard
   ```

2. **Edit `config.txt`** with your connection details:

   ```text
   # MQTT settings
   MQTT_BROKER=broker.example.com
   MQTT_PORT=8883
   MQTT_TOPIC=your/topic/#
   MQTT_USERNAME=optional_user
   MQTT_PASSWORD=optional_pass

   # InfluxDB settings
   INFLUX_URL=http://localhost:8086
   INFLUX_TOKEN=your_token_here
   INFLUX_ORG=your_org
   INFLUX_BUCKET=your_bucket

   # SQL Server settings
   SQL_AUTH=sql        # "windows" or "sql"
   SQL_SERVER=your_sql_server
   SQL_DATABASE=your_database
   SQL_USER=sa          # only for SQL auth
   SQL_PASS=            # only for SQL auth
   SQL_TABLE=historical_data
   ```

3. **Run the Windows installer** by double-clicking **`launch.bat`** or from PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .\launch.bat
   ```

   This script will:

   * Create and activate a Python virtual environment (`venv`)
   * Install dependencies: `paho-mqtt`, `influxdb-client`, `pyodbc`, `flask`, `psutil`
   * Launch the Flask dashboard on port 5050

---

## ðŸ“‚ `launch.bat` Installer Script

```bat
@echo off
REM === Robo Data Dashboard Installer ===

REM 1. Create and activate venv
python -m venv venv
call venv\Scripts\activate

echo Installing dependencies...
%venv%\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip
%venv%\Scripts\pip install paho-mqtt influxdb-client pyodbc flask psutil

echo Launching dashboard...
start "" cmd /k "%venv%\Scripts\python Tele_Robo_Bridge.py"

pause
```

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Usage

1. **Edit** `config.txt` with your settings.
2. **Launch** the dashboard via `launch.bat`.
3. **Browser** opens automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:5050/`.
4. **Monitor** the bridge status and device last-seen timestamps.
5. **Click** the "Run MQTT Bridge" button to start or restart the data bridge.
